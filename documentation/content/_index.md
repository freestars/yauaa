Works with Java, Scala, Kotlin and provides ready for use UDFs for several processing systems.

## HIGH Profile release notes:

### Version 6.4
- Updated log4j
- Better performance in multithreaded scenarios

### Version 6.3
- Report frozen (=manipulated) Mac OS X versions as `??`:
  - Always [10_15_7](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1175225) since Chrome 90.
  - Always [10.15](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent/Firefox#macintosh) since Firefox 87.

### Version 6.2
- The type of CPU is no longer (incorrectly) used as the version (Linux i386 --> Linux ??).
- The toMap incorrectly filtered out "default" values you asked for (which caused trouble in UDFs).
- A new (experimental) [UDF]({{< relref "Snowflake" >}}) for [Snowflake](https://snowflake.com).

### Version 6.1
- Support for the new `reduced` User-Agent as it is being implemented in Google Chrome/Chromium.
- Improved User Defined Function for Apache Beam SQL.
- Detect the first car based browsers. DeviceClass = Car

### Version 6.0
- Fully replaced SLF4J with Log4J2; since this is a breaking change the next version will be 6.0
- Dropping the native commandline version. Using the webservlet locally with curl is a lot faster.
